          Hey, I’m Gus, a Software Engineer based in New York City. When I’m not
          immersed in writing code, I enjoy exploring the city’s vibrant food
          culture and staying updated on the latest in sports. In my downtime, I
          like to stay active with occasional runs, unwind at the park, or enjoy
          video games with friends.
